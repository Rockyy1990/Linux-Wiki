Btrfs (B-tree file system) is a modern file system for Linux that includes several features such as snapshots, subvolumes, and integrated volume management. When configuring Btrfs in the /etc/fstab file for automatic mounting at system boot, there are several parameters you can use. Below are some common mount options for Btrfs along with examples of how to use them in the fstab file.
Common Btrfs Mount Options:

    defaults: Use default mount options.
    subvol=<subvolume>: Mount a specific subvolume.
    autodefrag: Enable automatic defragmentation.
    compress: Enable compression; can be set to zlib, zstd, or no.
    ssd: Optimize for SSD usage.
    user_subvol_rm_allowed: Allow non-root users to remove subvolumes.

Example Entries in /etc/fstab

Below are a few examples of how to use Btrfs with various mount options in the /etc/fstab.
Example 1: Basic Btrfs Mount with Defaults

 
UUID=YOUR-UUID-HERE /mnt/mybtrfs btrfs defaults 0 0

Replace YOUR-UUID-HERE with the actual UUID of your Btrfs filesystem.
Example 2: Mounting a Specific Subvolume

 
UUID=YOUR-UUID-HERE /mnt/mybtrfs btrfs defaults,subvol=myvolume 0 0

This mounts a specific subvolume named myvolume.
Example 3: Using Compression

 
UUID=YOUR-UUID-HERE /mnt/mybtrfs btrfs defaults,compress=zlib 0 0

This enables zlib compression on the Btrfs mount.
Example 4: Enabling Automatic Defragmentation and SSD Option

 
UUID=YOUR-UUID-HERE /mnt/mybtrfs btrfs defaults,autodefrag,ssd 0 0

This mounts the filesystem with automatic defragmentation and optimizations for SSDs.
Example 5: Allowing User Subvolume Removal

 
UUID=YOUR-UUID-HERE /mnt/mybtrfs btrfs defaults,user_subvol_rm_allowed 0 0

This allows non-root users to remove subvolumes.
Example 6: Combining Multiple Options

 
UUID=YOUR-UUID-HERE /mnt/mybtrfs btrfs defaults,subvol=myvolume,compress=zstd,autodefrag,ssd 0 0

This example combines multiple options for layered functionality.
Additional considerations

    Make sure to replace YOUR-UUID-HERE with the actual UUID of your Btrfs partition, which you can find using blkid or lsblk.
    When you modify /etc/fstab, always check for syntax errors using mount -a after making changes to ensure that there are no mistakes that would prevent the system from booting properly.

Final Note

When using Btrfs, itâ€™s important to understand the implications and performance of various mount options based on your use case (like personal data storage, server applications, etc.). Always consider backing up critical data before performing file system changes.
