To create a custom Arch Linux installation script using Calamares that includes specific software like Firefox, Thunderbird, and VLC, you need to perform several steps. Below is a guide to help you set up Calamares with a custom configuration so that these programs are installed during the installation process.

### Step 1: Install Calamares

First, ensure you have a running Arch Linux system where Calamares can be installed. If you're working with an ISO build or a live environment, you'll need to install Calamares.

```bash
sudo pacman -S calamares
```

### Step 2: Set Up Calamares Configuration

Calamares is highly configurable and relies on a set of configuration files to determine how the installer operates.

#### Directory Structure

Set up a directory structure for Calamares configuration files:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/calamares
```

You may want to include a directory for your custom settings and modules as well:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/calamares/modules
```

#### Configuration File

Create the main `calamares.conf` file, typically within `/etc/calamares`. You can start with some basic configurations:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/calamares/calamares.conf
```

Here is a simplified example of a Calamares configuration file:

```ini
# /etc/calamares/calamares.conf
Version: 3.3
Language: en_US
Desktop: plasma

Modules:
    - partition
    - users
    - installation
    - finish

# Additional configuration options...
```

#### Define the Installation Module

You'll need to configure the installation module to ensure your programs are installed post-installation. Create a custom script that installs your desired applications after the user finishes the Calamares installation process.

1. Create a script for installing apps:

```bash
sudo nano /usr/share/calamares/modules/install-apps.sh
```

2. Add the following content to the script to install Firefox, Thunderbird, and VLC:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install desired applications
pacman -S --noconfirm firefox thunderbird vlc
```

3. Make the script executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/share/calamares/modules/install-apps.sh
```

#### Add Installation Script to Calamares

Create or modify a file that will specify that your `install-apps.sh` script should run at the end of the installation process. You might create a new file in the modules folder:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/calamares/modules/installation.conf
```

In this file, include a directive to run your script:

```ini
# /etc/calamares/modules/installation.conf
# This runs after the main installation module

InstallApps:
    Command: "/usr/share/calamares/modules/install-apps.sh"
```

### Step 3: Testing Your Configuration

After setting everything up, create your Arch Linux ISO or boot an existing one that includes Calamares.

1. Test your installer by booting from the ISO.
2. Go through the installation process.
3. Upon completion, the specified applications (Firefox, Thunderbird, VLC) should install automatically.

### Final Notes

- Ensure that you have a proper package cache set up in the system to allow `pacman` to function correctly during installation.
- You may want to add additional error handling and checks to your scripts to ensure they run smoothly.
- Customize the Calamares interface with themes or additional tweaks if desired.

This is a basic implementation and can be tailored to meet your specific needs, including configuration for the system language, keyboard layout, and other packages. Be sure to consult the Calamares documentation for more advanced configurations if needed.
