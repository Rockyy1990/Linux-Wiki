XFS in /etc/fstab

Here is an example of how to configure an XFS filesystem in the /etc/fstab file:

 
/dev/sda1    /mnt/xfsdata   xfs    defaults,noatime,nofail    0    2

Explanation of the Options Used

    defaults: Use the default mount options (rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, and async).
    noatime: Do not update the access time on files, which can help improve performance.
    nofail: Do not fail to mount the filesystem at boot time if the device is not present.
    0: The dump field is set to 0, which means that the filesystem is not to be dumped.
    2: The pass number is set to 2, indicating that the filesystem check should be done after the root filesystem (which is usually 1).

Additional Mount Options

XFS supports various mount options that you can specify in the <options> field. Some useful options include:

    rw: Mount the filesystem read/write.
    ro: Mount the filesystem read-only.
    relatime: Update the inode access times relative to the last time the file was accessed.
    barrier=1: Enable write barriers (generally important for data integrity).
    logdev=/dev/sdX: Specify a dedicated log device for XFS (if required).
    attr2: Enables enhanced attribute support (this is usually the default).

Important Notes

    Always ensure that the specified <mount_point> directory exists before rebooting the system.
    Use the mount command to test your fstab changes without rebooting, e.g., mount -a.
    If you are unsure about the parameters or options, consult the man pages with man 5 fstab or man mount.
    Regular backups are recommended before making any changes to system files like /etc/fstab.

By configuring your /etc/fstab correctly for an XFS filesystem, you can ensure that it mounted with the desired options at boot time.
